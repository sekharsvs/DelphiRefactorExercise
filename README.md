DelphiRefactorExercise
======================

Refactoring is the process of improving the structure of code without changing its function.

The code in this repository is the kind you would expect to see from a beginning programmer in Delphi.

Change the code, and its structure to make it more cohesive and maintainable.  You are free to add new modules and classes.  You may include any frameworks you think are appropriate.

Pay attention to:
 - separation of concerns
 - testability
 - maintainability
 - SOLID principles
 - programming to interfaces, not implementations

While changing the UI is technically outside the normal domain of refactoring, for this case you can change the UI as long as it maintains its functional behaviour.

Ultimately, we would like to see you convert this application to something that you would be proud to publish on the web as an example of your best work.  This is a chance to show off your skills to us.
